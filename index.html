                <p class = "History-leading-to-skill"> I took IT as one of my elective subjects in High School from the 10th grade. This was where I was introduced to the JAVA programming language. I have since acquired the knowledge to build various types of applications, using JAVA. I struggled a lot in the beginning however, my love for the concept of Information Technology carried me to continue taking IT as a subject until my final High School year, so much so that I was able to complete my High School career with a distinction for IT. During my first year of University, I was introduced to the programming language R, which is used extensively to analayse and manage data to provide data scientists with sufficient information to provide key information to the relevant interested parties.</p>
