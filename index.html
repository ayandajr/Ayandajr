                <p class = "Descr-JAVA-Skill">I took IT as one of my elective subjects in High School from the 10th grade. This was where I was introduced to the JAVA programming language. I have since acquired the knowledge to build various types of applications, using JAVA. I struggled a lot in the beginning however, my love for the concept of Information Technology carried me to continue taking IT as a subject until my final High School year (Matric - Grade 12). I completed my High School career with a distinction for IT. </p>
